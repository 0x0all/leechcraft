	/** @brief Aids in adding actions to notifications.
	 *
	 * This class is used to easily add actions to notification entities
	 * created via MakeNotification() or MakeAN() functions. The usage is
	 * quite simple and best illustrated by an example:
	 * \code
	 * Entity e = Util::MakeNotification ("Header", "Title", PInfo_);
	 * auto nah = new Util::NotificationActionHandler (e);
	 * nah->AddFunction ("Open file", [fileURL] () { QDesktopServices::openUrl (fileURL); });
	 * \endcode
	 *
	 * The entity this handler is created upon takes ownership of the
	 * object, so when the last instance of the entity is destroyed this
	 * object is destroyed itself. The object should \em never be
	 * explicitly deleted.
	 *
	 * Some actions don't make sense if some other object is destroyed
	 * after emitting the entity but before the user has reacted to the
	 * event. For example, a user in an IRC channel writes to us a
	 * message then leaves. In this case the "Reply" action will be
	 * invalid and useless.
	 *
	 * To avoid this NotificationActionHandler supports dependent objects
	 * â€” objects whose destruction will render its actions useless.
	 * Dependent objects are added via the AddDependentObject() method
	 * and their lifetime is tracked automatically.
	 *
	 * @note Only one handler can be created on an entity. If multiple
	 * handlers are created, the last one is used.
	 *
	 * @sa MakeNotification(), MakeAN().
