	/** @brief A horizontal bar with typical widgets for text search.
	 *
	 * This widget provides typical features for text searching: a text
	 * input field, checkboxes for selecting find mode and buttons for
	 * searching and closing the notification, as well as convenience
	 * slots findNext() and findPrevious().
	 *
	 * The notification will automatically embed into a QVBoxLayout of
	 * its parent widget at the bottom, like in Poshuku or Monocle
	 * plugins.
	 *
	 * This class is typically used as following:
	 * -# It's subclassed, and an implementation of handleNext() function
	 *    is provided, which deals with the search process. For example,
	 *    a WebKit-based browser calls <code>QWebPage::findText()</code>.
	 *    The implementation may also call SetSuccessful() to indicate
	 *    whether anything has been found.
	 * -# An object of the subclass is created as a child of some page
	 *    containing searchable text, like a web page or a text document.
	 * -# It's hidden after that to not disturb the user until he
	 *    explicitly wishes to search for text.
	 * -# A QAction is created to trigger showing this notification, and
	 *    its <code>triggered()</code> signal is connected to this class'
	 *    show() and setFocus() slots (latter is needed so that user
	 *    can start typing his search query immediately).
	 * -# Optionally a couple of QShortCuts or QActions can be created
	 *    and connected to findNext() and findPrevious() slots to support
	 *    shortcuts for the corresponding actions.
