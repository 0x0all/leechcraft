/** @brief Interface for accessing LeechCraft-wide icons manager.
 *
 * The icon theme manager provides access to actions icon sets managed
 * globally in LeechCraft.
 *
 * The icons are identified by their Freedesktop.org-like name, and they
 * should be contained at least in the KDE's Oxygen icon theme.
 *
 * Icons may be retrieved via the GetIcon() method, and actions (QAction
 * subclasses) can be automatically set with a proper icon by setting
 * their \em ActionIcon dynamic property to the name of the desired icon.
 * This way they will also be automatically updated if the iconset
 * changes.
 *
 * Please note that the \em ActionIcon property should be set before
 * QAction (or its parent) widget is exposed to the rest oF LeechCraft
 * (for example, a menu embedded into a ITabWidget-implementing tab, or
 * an ITabWidget added to LeechCrat windows). Otherwise, UpdateIconset()
 * should be called on the actions for them to be registered.
