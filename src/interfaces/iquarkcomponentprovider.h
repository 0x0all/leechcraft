	 * same time. Each view defines a quark context. For example,
	 * the same panel of SB2 will have different contexts for different
	 * windows.
	 *
	 * \section cppcomm Communicating with C++
	 *
	 * Quarks may want to communicate with the C++ part of the providing
	 * plugin. Quark properties serve exactly this purpose.
	 *
	 * \section ctxprops Context-dependent and shareable properties
	 *
	 * Different views can share some properties and may need to have
	 * different others according to the quark context. Shareable
	 * properties should be listed in DynamicProps_ and StaticProps_,
	 * while unique per-view properties should be listed in
	 * ContextProps_. Context per-view properties will be destroyed if
	 * the quark is removed from the view.
	 *
	 * In other words, ownership of shareable properties is left for
	 * the quark component provider, while ownership of the
	 * context-dependent properties is transferred to the calling view.
