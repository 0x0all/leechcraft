	 * The urlsReady() signal is emitted as soon as the URLs of the

	 * either wait for the convenience ready() signal after which the
	 * object would be destroyed, or delete the object himself.
	 *
	 * @note The object of this class should schedule its deletion (via
	 * <code>QObject::deleteLater()</code>, for example) after the ready()
	 * signal is emitted. Thus the calling code should never delete it
	 * explicitly after this signal, neither it should use this object
	 * after ready() signal or connect to its signals via
	 * <code>Qt::QueuedConnection</code>.
