	 * This interface is used when a backend can't open a document, but
	 * can convert it to a format probably openable by another Monocle
	 * plugin.
	 *
	 * The GetRedirectedMime() method returns the MIME of the converted
	 * document.
	 *
	 * GetRedirectSource() returns the filename of the source document,
	 * and GetRedirectTarget() returns the filename of the converted
	 * document.
	 *
	 * The redirect proxy should start converting after a small delay
	 * after construction (like after spinning the main event loop via
	 * QTimer with a zero timeout). This is because temporary
	 * IRedirectProxy objects can be requested by Monocle to get the
	 * MIME type of the redirected document without actually converting
	 * it.
	 *
	 * @sa IBackendPlugin
