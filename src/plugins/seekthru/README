== ISyncable notes ==
Delta's payload is a QByteArray obtained from QDataStream, which is
always fed with the following two variables:
|-- quint8 version --|-- quint16 action --|
Only one version, 0, is currently supported.

There are three actions:
- 0 for DADescrAdded, in which case the rest of payload is a serialized
  Description. This action means that a opensearch engine description
  should be added.
- 1 for DADescrRemoved, in which case the rest of payload is QString
  with the engine's ShortName_. This action means that opensearch engine
  with the given short name should be removed.
- 2 for DATagsTagsChanged, in which case the rest of payload is
  |-- QString shortName --|-- QStringList tags --|
  This action means that opensearch engine with the given short name
  should now have the given tags (in human-readable form, of course).
